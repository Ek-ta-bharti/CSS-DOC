In CSS, the `filter` property allows you to apply graphical effects like blur, grayscale, brightness adjustment, and more to elements on a web page. Here's a brief overview of some common filter functions:

1. **Blur**: Blurs the element. The higher the value, the more blurry the element becomes.

```css
.blur {
  filter: blur(5px); /* 5px blur */
}
```

2. **Grayscale**: Converts the element to grayscale. The value ranges from 0 (no grayscale) to 100% (completely grayscale).

```css
.grayscale {
  filter: grayscale(50%); /* 50% grayscale */
}
```

3. **Brightness**: Adjusts the brightness of the element. Values greater than 100% make the element brighter, while values less than 100% make it darker.

```css
.brightness {
  filter: brightness(150%); /* 150% brightness */
}
```

4. **Contrast**: Adjusts the contrast of the element. Values greater than 100% increase contrast, while values less than 100% decrease contrast.

```css
.contrast {
  filter: contrast(150%); /* 150% contrast */
}
```

5. **Saturate**: Increases or decreases the saturation of the element. Values greater than 100% increase saturation, while values less than 100% decrease saturation.

```css
.saturate {
  filter: saturate(200%); /* 200% saturation */
}
```

6. **Hue Rotate**: Rotates the hue of the element. The angle specifies the number of degrees around the color circle the element's colors should be adjusted.

```css
.hue-rotate {
  filter: hue-rotate(90deg); /* Rotate hue by 90 degrees */
}
```

7. **Invert**: Inverts the colors of the element. A value of 100% results in complete inversion.

```css
.invert {
  filter: invert(100%); /* Complete color inversion */
}
```

8. **Opacity**: Adjusts the opacity of the element. Values range from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).

```css
.opacity {
  filter: opacity(50%); /* 50% opacity */
}
```

You can combine multiple filter functions by separating them with spaces:

```css
.combined-filter {
  filter: grayscale(50%) blur(5px);
}
```

This applies a 50% grayscale effect and a 5px blur effect simultaneously. Experiment with different values and combinations to achieve the desired visual effects for your elements. Note that some filter effects may not be supported in older browsers, so it's important to test compatibility across different platforms.
