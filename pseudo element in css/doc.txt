Pseudo-elements in CSS allow you to style certain parts of an element without adding extra HTML. They are denoted by double colons (::) and are used to style specific parts of an element's content, such as the first letter, the first line, or generated content.

Common pseudo-elements include:

1. `::before`: Inserts content before the content of the selected element.
2. `::after`: Inserts content after the content of the selected element.
3. `::first-letter`: Selects the first letter of the text content of an element.
4. `::first-line`: Selects the first line of the text content of an element.

Here's an example of how you can use pseudo-elements in CSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Pseudo-elements Example</title>
<style>
    /* Using ::before pseudo-element to add content before a paragraph */
    p::before {
        content: "Start: ";
        color: blue;
    }

    /* Using ::after pseudo-element to add content after a paragraph */
    p::after {
        content: " :End";
        color: red;
    }

    /* Styling the first letter of a paragraph */
    p::first-letter {
        font-size: 150%;
        color: green;
    }

    /* Styling the first line of a paragraph */
    p::first-line {
        font-weight: bold;
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:

- The `::before` pseudo-element adds the text "Start: " before the content of each paragraph, styled in blue.
- The `::after` pseudo-element adds the text " :End" after the content of each paragraph, styled in red.
- The `::first-letter` pseudo-element increases the font size and changes the color of the first letter of each paragraph to green.
- The `::first-line` pseudo-element makes the first line of each paragraph bold.

Pseudo-elements are useful for adding decorative content, such as quotes or icons, without altering the HTML structure, and for styling specific parts of the content in a more granular way.
