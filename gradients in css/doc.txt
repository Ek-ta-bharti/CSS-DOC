Gradients in CSS allow you to smoothly transition between two or more colors. Gradients can be applied to backgrounds, borders, or even text. There are several types of gradients you can create in CSS:

1. **Linear Gradients**: These gradients transition from one color to another along a straight line.

```css
.linear-gradient {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);
}
```

This creates a linear gradient that transitions from red to blue horizontally.

2. **Radial Gradients**: These gradients transition from one color to another in a circular pattern.

```css
.radial-gradient {
  background: radial-gradient(red, blue);
}
```

This creates a radial gradient that transitions from red to blue starting from the center and spreading outward.

3. **Color Stops**: You can specify multiple color stops to create more complex gradients.

```css
.complex-gradient {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, red, green 30%, blue);
}
```

This creates a linear gradient that transitions from red to green at 30% of the way, then to blue.

4. **Angle**: You can specify the direction of the gradient using angles.

```css
.angle-gradient {
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, red, blue);
}
```

This creates a linear gradient that transitions from red to blue at a 45-degree angle.

5. **Repeating Gradients**: You can create gradients that repeat across an element.

```css
.repeating-gradient {
  background: repeating-linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow 10%, green 20%);
}
```

This creates a repeating linear gradient that transitions from red to yellow at 10% intervals, then to green at 20% intervals.

Gradients are quite versatile and can be used in various creative ways to enhance the visual appeal of your web pages.
