In CSS, perspective refers to the illusion of depth on a 2D plane, typically used in 3D transformations. This allows you to create elements that appear to be positioned at different distances from the viewer, giving a sense of depth and realism to your designs. The perspective property defines how far away the 3D object appears from the viewer's perspective. 

Here's how you can use perspective in CSS:

1. **Perspective Property**: This property is applied to the parent container of the element(s) you want to transform in 3D space. It defines the distance between the z=0 plane and the viewer. The larger the value, the further away the object appears from the viewer, resulting in a stronger perspective effect.

    ```css
    .container {
        perspective: 1000px;
    }
    ```

2. **Transform Property**: Once you've defined the perspective on the container, you can then use the transform property along with other transform functions like rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ, translateX, translateY, translateZ, etc., to position and rotate elements in 3D space.

    ```css
    .element {
        transform: rotateY(45deg);
    }
    ```

3. **Backface Visibility**: By default, the back faces of transformed elements are visible. You can control this behavior using the `backface-visibility` property to hide the back face if it's not needed.

    ```css
    .element {
        backface-visibility: hidden;
    }
    ```

4. **Perspective Origin**: You can also control the origin of the perspective effect. By default, it's at the center of the element, but you can adjust it using the `perspective-origin` property.

    ```css
    .container {
        perspective-origin: 50% 50%; /* Centered perspective */
    }
    ```

These properties allow you to create various 3D effects and animations in CSS, giving depth and realism to your web designs. It's important to note that while CSS 3D transforms can create impressive effects, they should be used judiciously as excessive use can impact performance and accessibility.
