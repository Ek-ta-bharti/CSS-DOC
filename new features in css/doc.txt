As of my last update in January 2022, CSS continues to evolve with new features and enhancements being introduced regularly. Here are some newer features and specifications that have been introduced or are in development:

1. **CSS Grid Layout**: CSS Grid Layout provides a two-dimensional grid-based layout system, allowing for more complex and flexible web layouts. It enables precise control over column and row positioning, making it easier to create responsive designs.

2. **CSS Flexbox**: Flexbox, also known as Flexible Box Layout, is a one-dimensional layout model that allows for the alignment and distribution of space among items in a container. It's particularly useful for building responsive layouts and aligning items within a container.

3. **CSS Variables (Custom Properties)**: CSS Variables allow developers to define reusable values that can be used throughout a stylesheet. They provide more dynamic and maintainable styling options by allowing values to be updated dynamically using JavaScript.

4. **CSS Containment**: The `contain` property allows developers to isolate a subtree of the DOM and control its layout, style, and paint behavior. This can lead to performance improvements by minimizing the scope of CSS and layout recalculations.

5. **CSS Scroll Snap**: Scroll snapping allows for precise control over the behavior of scrollable containers by defining specific points where scrolling should stop. This is particularly useful for creating carousel-like interfaces and improving the user experience of scrolling through content.

6. **CSS Logical Properties and Values**: Logical properties and values provide a way to define styles based on logical directions (e.g., `inline-start` instead of `left` or `right`). This makes it easier to create layouts that adapt to different writing modes, such as left-to-right or right-to-left languages.

7. **Aspect Ratio Boxes**: The `aspect-ratio` property allows developers to define an aspect ratio for an element, ensuring that it maintains its aspect ratio even as its dimensions change. This is particularly useful for creating responsive designs with elements like images or videos.

8. **Container Queries (in development)**: Container Queries are a highly anticipated feature that will allow styles to be applied based on the size of a container rather than the viewport. This will enable more modular and reusable components in CSS, particularly for responsive designs.

These are just a few examples of the newer features and enhancements introduced to CSS in recent years. CSS continues to evolve, with ongoing efforts to improve layout capabilities, responsiveness, and developer productivity.
