It seems like you may have a typo in your query. If you're referring to CSS Grid, it's a powerful layout system in CSS that allows you to create two-dimensional grid-based layouts. With CSS Grid, you can define rows and columns, and then place items within those rows and columns. Here's a basic example:

HTML:
```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="item">1</div>
  <div class="item">2</div>
  <div class="item">3</div>
  <div class="item">4</div>
  <div class="item">5</div>
  <div class="item">6</div>
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px; /* Three columns, each 100px wide */
  grid-gap: 10px; /* Gap between grid items */
}

.item {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

In this example:

- `display: grid;` sets the container as a grid container.
- `grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px;` defines three columns, each 100 pixels wide.
- `grid-gap: 10px;` creates a 10-pixel gap between grid items.
- `.item` styles the individual grid items with a background color, padding, and center-aligned text.

CSS Grid provides many more features for creating complex layouts, such as grid template areas, grid auto-placement, and grid alignment properties (`justify-items`, `align-items`, etc.). It's supported in modern browsers and is often used alongside Flexbox to create sophisticated and responsive layouts on the web.
