In CSS, the `color` property is used to specify the color of text. The value of the `color` property can be specified using various formats such as named colors, hexadecimal, RGB, RGBA, HSL, and HSLA. Here are examples of each:

1. **Named Colors:** You can use predefined color names such as `red`, `blue`, `green`, etc.
   ```css
   color: red;
   ```

2. **Hexadecimal Notation:** Hexadecimal notation represents colors using a combination of six characters (3 pairs of values representing Red, Green, and Blue intensities).
   ```css
   color: #FF0000; /* Red */
   ```

3. **RGB Notation:** RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values specify the intensity of the color components separately.
   ```css
   color: rgb(255, 0, 0); /* Red */
   ```

4. **RGBA Notation:** RGBA is similar to RGB but includes an alpha channel (transparency) as the fourth parameter.
   ```css
   color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Semi-transparent Red */
   ```

5. **HSL Notation:** HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) notation represents colors based on their hue, saturation, and lightness.
   ```css
   color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%); /* Red */
   ```

6. **HSLA Notation:** HSLA is similar to HSL but includes an alpha channel (transparency) as the fourth parameter.
   ```css
   color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5); /* Semi-transparent Red */
   ```

You can use any of these formats to specify colors in CSS, depending on your preference and requirements.
