In CSS, the `color` property is used to specify the color of text. The value of the `color` property can be specified using various formats such as named colors, hexadecimal, RGB, RGBA, HSL, and HSLA. Here are examples of each:

1. **Named Colors:** You can use predefined color names such as `red`, `blue`, `green`, etc.
   ```css
   color: red;
   ```

2. **Hexadecimal Notation:** Hexadecimal notation represents colors using a combination of six characters (3 pairs of values representing Red, Green, and Blue intensities).
   ```css
   color: #FF0000; /* Red */
   ```

3. **RGB Notation:** RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values specify the intensity of the color components separately.
   ```css
   color: rgb(255, 0, 0); /* Red */
   ```

4. **RGBA Notation:** RGBA is similar to RGB but includes an alpha channel (transparency) as the fourth parameter.
   ```css
   color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Semi-transparent Red */
   ```

5. **HSL Notation:** HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) notation represents colors based on their hue, saturation, and lightness.
   ```css
   color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%); /* Red */
   ```

6. **HSLA Notation:** HSLA is similar to HSL but includes an alpha channel (transparency) as the fourth parameter.
   ```css
   color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5); /* Semi-transparent Red */
   ```

You can use any of these formats to specify colors in CSS, depending on your preference and requirements.

In CSS, you can manipulate colors using various techniques such as adjusting the hue, tint, shade, and tone. Here's how you can achieve each effect:

1. **Hue:** Hue represents the pure color without any tint or shade added. You can adjust the hue of a color using the `hue-rotate()` function in CSS. This function rotates the hue of the color wheel.
   
   ```css
   /* Rotate the hue by 90 degrees (shifts the color towards green) */
   filter: hue-rotate(90deg);
   ```

2. **Tint:** A tint is created by mixing a color with white, which lightens the original color. You can achieve this by adjusting the `opacity` property or using `rgba()` with a higher alpha value.

   ```css
   /* Tint of red with 50% opacity */
   color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
   ```

3. **Shade:** A shade is created by mixing a color with black, which darkens the original color. You can achieve this by adjusting the `opacity` property or using `rgba()` with a lower alpha value.

   ```css
   /* Shade of blue with 50% opacity */
   color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5);
   ```

4. **Tone:** A tone is created by mixing a color with both black and white. This alters the saturation and lightness of the color. You can achieve this using the `brightness()` function in CSS.

   ```css
   /* Adjust the brightness to create a toned color */
   filter: brightness(80%);
   ```

These are some basic techniques for adjusting colors in CSS. They allow you to manipulate hues, tints, shades, and tones to achieve various visual effects in your web designs.
